## Synopsis
Protoype/Experimental code for Chrome extension YouTube player.

## Version 1
Create a project folder "youT-v1". Implement a simple chrome extension that prints "Hello World". The application icon should appear on the bookmarkbar. When clicked upon, a square frame should appear with "Hello World" text. Implement a setting page that allows users to change text displayed. Don't worry about the icon design. Use whatever is available.
## Version 2
Create a project folder "youT-v2". Based on the previous version, now the text should be synced with the Google Account. When logged in a different Chrome browser, saved text should appear on the frame when clicked upon.
## Version 3
Create a project folder "youT-v3". NOT based on the previous versions. Create an entirely different project that 'maynot' be based on the Chrome extension framework. Looking at the YouTube API page. Get 'somesort' of web-application to play a simple YouTube video given a link.
